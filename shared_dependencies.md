1. Rails Framework: All the files are built using the Rails framework, which provides the structure and conventions for the application.

2. Post Model: The Post model is shared across the controller, views, and migration files. It defines the data schema for the posts in the database.

3. CRUD Operations: The create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations are shared across the controller and views. They define the functionality of the application.

4. Routes: The routes file configures the URLs for the CRUD operations.

5. Database Configuration: The database.yml and the migration file share the configuration for the PostgreSQL database.

6. Form Partial: The _form.html.erb partial is shared across the new and edit views. It contains the form for creating and updating posts.

7. Gemfile and Gemfile.lock: These files share the dependencies for the Rails application.

8. DOM Elements: The views may share DOM elements such as form fields and buttons, which can be targeted by JavaScript functions.

9. Flash Messages: The controller may use flash messages to communicate the result of CRUD operations to the user. These messages can be displayed in the views.

10. Function Names: The controller shares function names with the routes and views. These functions include the CRUD operations and any additional actions defined in the controller.
